## Green Done Wright

My name is Andrew Wright. The journey pursuing a more sustainable lifestyle has been long and fulfilling. With a B.S. in Environmental Science as my foundation, I strive to teach and empower others who value sustainability and are hungry for more knowledge and experience.  

This passion began with a vision to build a composting system and evolved into what became the start of a community garden at my university. My passion to build sustainable systems led me to become a master composter through Master Composter Recycling course out in Vancouver, Washington. In the further pursuit of knowledge, I have a LEED Green Associate certification, Sustainability Ambassador of Atlanta and Master Composter Recycler certification.
